# zepp-health-care-hasley

React Native Android module help me navigate to Zepp App and some thing like react-native-send-intent. Thanks for [react-native-send-intent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-send-intent). :)))

This module is useful when you need to share some text between apps in Android device and if you have a valid phone number make some call directly (if you ask for permission in AndroidManifest.xml).

E.g.: You have and short text and want to share in a SMS or Whatsapp.

### Installation

```bash
npm install zepp-health-care-hasley --save
```

### I have add gotoOtherApp to nav to other app
